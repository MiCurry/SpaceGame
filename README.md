# Space Game

As of this writing this readme file, this version of the game is built off 
of a development revision of arcade (3.0.0.dev.26).

# Run the Game Locally

Assuming you have arcade installed (and the correct revision)

```Bash
python space.py
```

# Build the game

Build the game using the build script:

```commandline
python3.11 build.py
```

Use `-d` to just print out what the command arguments will be:

```commandline
python3.11 build.py -d
```

Note: You'll need to use something version of python not greater than 3.11.
